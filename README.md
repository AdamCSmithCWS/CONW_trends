Estimating population trends for Connecticut Warbler

Connecticut Warbler population trends are partly dependent on the model and the underlying geographic stratifications.

To explore the among-model variation in our understanding of the species' population trends, we fit the data to two models, each at two different spatial-grained stratifications. The two models are a GAMYE and a first-difference model (). The two stratifications are a coarse-grained stratification based on the intersection of BCRs (Bird Conservation Regions) that we refer to here as the "bbs_usgs" and a finer-grained stratification based on a latitude by longitude 1-degree grid-cell that we refer to here as "latlong".
